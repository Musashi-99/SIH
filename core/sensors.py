"""SatQuery AI v2 — sensor / band abstraction.

Instead of assuming ``RGB means fixed wavelengths`` everywhere, the pipeline
resolves a lightweight :class:`BandMapping` at ingestion time. Spectral-index
code then asks the mapping which logical bands exist instead of guessing.

Only mappings flagged ``verified=True`` are claimed as supported. Planned
sensors ship their band tables for future use but are explicitly marked
experimental — the system never claims to support a sensor it cannot
actually ingest.
